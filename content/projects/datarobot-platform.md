# AI Platform Developer Experience

## Overview

Redesigned the developer onboarding experience for DataRobot's AI platform, focusing on reducing friction and improving time-to-value for new users.

## Problem

The existing developer onboarding flow had several pain points:
- Long time-to-first-model (average 2+ hours)
- Unclear documentation and API examples
- Disconnected learning resources
- No clear path from signup to production

## Solution

### Streamlined Onboarding Flow

Created a guided onboarding experience that:
- Provides interactive API tutorials
- Offers pre-configured example projects
- Includes real-time code validation
- Connects documentation directly to the IDE

### Key Improvements

1. **Interactive Tutorials**: Step-by-step guides with live code examples
2. **Quick Start Templates**: Pre-built project templates for common use cases
3. **Integrated Documentation**: Context-aware help within the platform
4. **Progress Tracking**: Visual indicators showing completion status
